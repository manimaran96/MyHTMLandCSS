		Once upon a time, there was a king who kept a monkey as a pet.
		The monkey served the king by all the possible ways.
		</p>
		<div>
		It was very hot in those days. So one day, when the king was sleeping, 
monkey was fanning the king. Suddenly monkey noticed a fly on the chest of the king. The monkey tried to swish it away. But fly would go away for one moment and come back again.
		</div>
		<div> So monkey decided to teach a lesson to the fly.</div>
<pre>
The monkey then looked for something to hit a fly.
It then found a stick.
It picked up the stick and tried to beat the fly using stick.
Hmmm       at last it found a fly and  
with all the force it hit the fly as a result of which the king died.

Lesson from the story:Never keep a fool servant !!!
